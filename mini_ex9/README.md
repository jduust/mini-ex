For this flowchart i choose to draw one of the more advanced exercises i've made, a game. I liked the challenge of implemnting all the rules and input into a flowchart. This is therefore also the ones i chose to display in my flowchart, sort of like a ruleset for a game. Just like if you were to buy a new board game you've never tried before, then you find the ruleset and instructions, which i thought could be displayed in a flowchart.

## Ideas for the final project

**Idea:** Neuralizer of web content

We mainly want to focus on the topic of code and language in the digital culture. We want to create a program that can manipulate what is visually accessible to you, and often forced upon you while you are engaged in the digital world. We want to challange the lacking of control of the contemporary constant feeds and data streams that we experience on the web. This by creating something that affords the individual to choose and take control of what is shown to them and therefore make web content from external sources less powerful (ex. the browser extension AdBlock).

Our ideas strives from a program that removes adjectives, to one that neutralizes genders or even one that can change negative words into positive ones. To make a program with functions like these, we will have to make a web extension that is able to examine the content of the current webpage and be able replace or manipulate it.

The flowchart we have made for this idea is based on an algorithm that is supposed to get the news articles from a website, analyse the text for adjectives and then remove them. When the program as gone through the whole text it shal print the new and changed article.

**The second idea and flowchart:**
Our idea for the second flowchart is in the same category as our first idea. Instead of a program that removes adjectives, we want this program to have an input field where you can write different words you don’t want to read articles about. So like our first idea the program will get an article or some other content from a website, and then analyse the content for the keywords that you didn’t want to see. This program gives the users some control of what they are going to look at online by choosing what not to see.

###How is this flow chart different from the one that you had in #2 (in terms of the role of a flow chart)?
I'm not sure about this question exactly, if it's between the first idea and the second idea, the difference is that in the first we would make a fixed template for the program that it would executer regardless of user prefernce. It would therefore also often result in nonsense, by removing all adjectives from for example a news article. We also thought about implementing a few keywords it would replace automatically, like changing he/she to 'this person', or race to 'human'. 

This sort of leads us to our second idea, or our second flowchart, which allows the user to write keywords themselves, and if the plugin finds these keywords, they will completely remove all elements with the keywords in them. This is more like censoring completely, so if you're tired of hearing about trump, you could remove all news headlines about him on your news site. It's different in the way that it doesn't just replace the words, it completely removes all elements that are tied to it.

In regards to the second question, i've touched on this a bit earlier, on how flowcharts can act as a rulebook. But as any other human made object, it's not neutral, it's subject to our thoughts and our agenda, and in my opinion, it's very personal. This was also displayed in class where basically none of the 15+ flowcharts we each made about the same thing were identical. Flowcharts are algorithms in a sense, they contain a recipe (atleast in my case) for whatever you choose to display in them. But flowcharts can perhaps help understand advanced algorithms better, by displaying the rules of which the algorithms run by. Which is a major point mentioned in the text, that we a deeper understanding of algorithms, in order to understand how they affect us.
