## The program
This mini exercise was the hardest for me. Not in terms of programming, or the task itself. It was in terms of creating something together, and creating a solution that everyone agreed upon. I was in a group with Thomas Holm Eg Matthiesen and Jesper Vendelbo.  We all had different ideas, I myself am very product and user oriented, i want to make something that has a simple purpose and a visual feedback that you can interact with. This is probably a result of my current and past jobs as a webshop manager, that has shaped my way of thinking about coding a product. So when we were told about this exercise, i immidiatly thought of creating something that would play sound and display text. 

But Jesper and Thomas saw it differntly, they wanted to create variables and functions that would function as code while actually telling a story in the source code. At first they created a program using variables with the names of our school and the sun, but as they said afterward it was kinda to provoke me, and it did. It made me "compromise", to telling a story in the source code, without having a visual result that you can interact with. Thomas suggested we used the lyrics from "This old man", and it made sense to me, since the song works a bit like a program. Each verse adds one, and variables, just like a for loop would. 

But making a for loop to generate the song would be too complicated for us, so we tried making the song in the source code, into an error-free program. It had to make a bit sence though, so we made stuff like 'knick knack' a function.

MORE TEXT TO COME

| Original verse | Our code |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This old man, he plays one He plays knick knack on my thumb With a knick knack paddy wack Give a dog a bone This old man comes rolling home | this.man = old; 
hePlays(1) knickknack('thumb','my') knickknackpaddywack('bone','dog') oldman.position = homex, homey |
| This old man, he plays five Don't play knick knack on that hive With a knick knack paddy wack  Give a dog a bone This old man comes rolling home | this.man = old; hePlays(5); //knickknack('hive','that') knickknackpaddywack('bone','dog') oldman.position = homex, homey |
| This old man, he plays ten He plays knick knack all over again With a knick knack paddy wack Give a dog a bone This old man comes rolling home | this.man = old; hePlays(10); knickknack('repeat') knickknackpaddywack('bone','dog') oldman.position = homex, homey |
