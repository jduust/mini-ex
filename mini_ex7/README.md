## The program
This mini exercise was the hardest for me. Not in terms of programming, or the task itself. It was in terms of creating something together, and creating a solution that everyone agreed upon. I was in a group with Thomas Holm Eg Matthiesen and Jesper Vendelbo.  We all had different ideas, I myself am very product and user oriented, i want to make something that has a simple purpose and a visual feedback that you can interact with. This is probably a result of my current and past jobs as a webshop manager, that has shaped my way of thinking about coding a product. So when we were told about this exercise, i immidiatly thought of creating something that would play sound and display text. 

But Jesper and Thomas saw it differntly, they wanted to create variables and functions that would function as code while actually telling a story in the source code. At first they created a program using variables with the names of our school and the sun, but as they said afterward it was kinda to provoke me, and it did. It made me "compromise", to telling a story in the source code, without having a visual result that you can interact with. Thomas suggested we used the lyrics from "This old man", and it made sense to me, since the song works a bit like a program. Each verse adds one, and variables, just like a for loop would. 

But making a for loop to generate the song would be too complicated for us, so we tried making the song in the source code, into an error-free program. It had to make a bit sence though, so we made stuff like 'knick knack' a function, and the old variable, which is 99 (as in 99 years old). 

But staring at a white canvas would probably confuse a lot of people, so we decided to embed a lyric video of the song in the html, in order to lead people on, and hope they would check the source code after wondering why there was just a youtube video playing. Our code is also lyrics, translated to p5js language. If you reverse translated it, you probably wouldn't get the same results, but the same happens if you translate something to english and back again.

What people don't realize, is that the program is actually running, executing the lyrics, and completing it's task. It's just weird for most people (myself included), knowing that a program is running, but it's not resulting in anything you can interact with, or any visual feedback. It isn't saving anything on your computer, or generating/computing something "useful". I think it's a nice "upside-down" world to have the video playing and singing the lyrics while the our program is running it in the background, independently. 

This is interesting also in terms of Cox and McLeans point about codes primary function is to be executed by computers, and secondly to be understood by humans. A computer doesn't have to understand in the same way we do, as long as it can execute it without errors, it does so, without questions. I always feel the need to understand the code, so this exercise really took a toll on me in the beginning, but in the end i understood the purpose.
